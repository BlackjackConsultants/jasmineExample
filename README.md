# Running jasmine tests on angularjs application.
This is an angularjs application that runs each example on an angularjs view.  The application is encapsulated in a visual studio solution for ease of use.  The project uses jasmine, ngMock to create the unit tests and then to run them it uses nodejs and karma. 

## To run it on your machine do the following:

## First: Install pre-requisites:
Install node.js and karma to run tests.  You only do this once.
1. install node.js as cited [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
2. install karma
```
    npm install -g karma
```
2. install angular-cli

## Second: Once pre-requisites are installed then:

1. clone this project by opening command prompt.
